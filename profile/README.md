Relution is the GDPR-compliant Mobile Device Management solution for schools, public authorities, administrations and companies. With Relution, both mobile and stationary devices can be easily managed through an intuitive interface. Whether itâ€™s smartphones, tablets, laptops, computers, or interactive whiteboards, all digital devices can be quickly and easily configured, equipped, and controlled.

- **Data protection compliant**: Relution ensures compliance with strict European data protection requirements. Data on the devices, such as location data or photos, cannot be read by Relution.
- **Data sovereignty**: Relution enables data protection compliant operation, either in the school's own infrastructure (on premises) or in a German encrypted cloud.
- **Platform-independency**: The platform-independent offering supports the overarching use of the common operating systems of Apple, Android and Windows, and enables mixed operation of deployed devices.
- **Open for integration**: Local file shares (SMB, WebDAV) can be integrated for access to relevant documents and content. Data and work results can be stored securely on a central server. Local user directories can be integrated for cross-system authentication.
